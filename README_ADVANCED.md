## 🎮 Usage Examples

### Basic Chat
```python
ai = initialize_ai()

# Simple conversation
ai.respond_to_query("Hello!")
# → "Hello! I'm Advanced LamAI. How can I help you today?"

# Complex reasoning
ai.respond_to_query("Why do we need to sleep?")
# → Detailed chain-of-thought explanation with reasoning steps
```

### Mathematical Problems
```python
# The AI can solve math problems step by step
ai.respond_to_query("What is 15 * (20 + 5)?")
# → Shows reasoning steps and provides answer: 375
```

### Web Search & Information
```python
# Automatic tool usage for information gathering
ai.respond_to_query("Search Wikipedia for machine learning")
# → Retrieves and summarizes Wikipedia content

ai.respond_to_query("Look up latest news about AI")
# → Performs web search and provides results
```

### Continuous Learning
```python
from continuous_learning import add_continuous_learning

# Add learning capabilities
ai = add_continuous_learning(ai)

# Provide feedback for improvement
ai.learn_from_feedback(
    query="What is Python?",
    response="Python is a programming language",
    feedback={"rating": 5, "helpful": True}
)
```
